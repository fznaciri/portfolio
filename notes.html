                <p class="description">I first started working on a new draft of my portfolio in 2011. I haven't been working on this update for two years, but I have been coming back to it ever few months. It's undergone <a class="link" href="#">countless iterations.</a></p>
                <p class="description">Why has it taken so long? I've been afraid to commit to any one idea. It seemed like when I would decide upon a certain direction, the web would up and change its game (think responsive design). This was more down to me taking my sweet time more than anything else.</p>
                <p class="description">Not that I'm complaining. It practically became a hobby of mine to tinker with a new portfolio. In a way I'm a little sad that the sketching / prototyping / designing / coding elements of the portfolio are ultimately finished, but I'm excited to add some flourishes in the coming weeks and months (I've been toying with <a class="link" href="#">snap svg</a> which I'm looking forward to integrating).</p>
                <p class="description">In the next few weeks I'm also going to write about the decisions I made while building out this site - inspiration, evolution, content management, execution. Hopefully it may be of some use to those starting out with building their first portfolio - maybe help shave a year or two off it here and there!</p>
